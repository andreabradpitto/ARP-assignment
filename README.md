# ARP-assignment V2.0

This is my repository for the assignment of Advanced and Robot Programming (ARP) Robotics Engineering course.  
There are 2 versions of the assignment specifications: [V1.0](doc/Assignment%20Specifications%20V1.0.pdf) and
 [V2.0](doc/Assignment%20Specifications%20V2.0.pdf). This is because of the COVID-19 outbreak, which made the
 first version unfeasible for health and safety reasons. My implementation is relative to the second and most
 recent version, but I decided to still include the original specifications file for the sake of completeness.

## ‚ùó Software requirements

- A [**POSIX**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)-compliant machine
- [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- At least 1 MB of free disk space (though running the code for a long time may produce huge log file sizes)

## ‚úÖ Software installation

In order to create the executables, open a terminal, move to this folder, and then run:

```bash
make
```

The make file will take care of compiling all the code needed.  
If you want to remove the executables (and the log file, if present), instead type:

```bash
make clean
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è :arrow_forward: Execution

To run the code, open a terminal, move to the folder where this repository is located, and then run:

```bash
./main
```

The main process will take care of launching all the other processes. You can stop everything by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal where *main* has been launched. Notice that Ctrl+C is actually just the `SIGINT` **POSIX** signal.

## üì∞ Additional information

This assignment has been coded in [Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) (64 bit), and tested with an [Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz √ó 8](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/149091/intel-core-i7-8565u-processor-8m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz.html). The code has been compiled via gcc, version 9.3.0 [(Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04)](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/gcc-9).  

Process list and brief description:

- [main](src/main.c): This is the main, which launches all the other processes. The duty of this piece of code
 is to load configuration data and to launch all the involved processes (S, P, G and L)

- [S](src/S.c): This is the process that is used to communicate with the others. It is the only one that interfaces with the terminal.
 It can receive and handle 3 different commands: start, pause, log. In order to use it, you have to type e.g. "kill -18 1234",
 where the first number is the signal chosen, whilst the second is the PID of the node S itself.
 This process then communicates with P, spreading user commands through all the children of main

- [P](src/P.c): This process is the computational core. It is also the nevralgic waypoint of communications:
 all other nodes involved are, in a way or another, bond to P. This process uses different constants
 based on RUN_MODE. A fake delay is added to the computation when RUN_MODE = 0. RUN_MODE = 1 scenario
 has P expecting data from the G process of the previous PC in the chain

- [G](src/G.c): This process can be run in 2 modes: debug mode (i.e. single machine/covid/V2.0 - RUN_MODE = 0) or
 normal mode (i.e.communicating with other PCs - RUN_MODE = 1). In the first case it receives tokens
 from P, and then sends them back to it. In the other scenario, it sends data to the P of the next PC in the chain

- [L](src/L.c): This process is the one responsible of logging. It registers every command issued by the user
 and every token processed by P (received/sent). When prompted, it opens the current log file via the user's preferred application
