# ARP-assignment

This is my repository for the Advanced and Robot Programming Robotics Engineering course

This is the readme for the brach devoted to the **Mentore** Graphical User Interface (**GUI**) development.

## ‚ùó Software requirements

- gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0

## ‚úÖ Software installation

In order to create the executables, open a terminal, move to this folder, and then run:

```bash
make
```

The make file will take care of compiling all the code needed.  
If you want to remove the executables (and the log file, if present), instead type:

```bash
make clean
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Instructions

To run the code, open a terminal, move to the folder where this repository is located, and then run:

```bash
./main
```

The main process will take care of launching all the other processes. You can stop everything by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal where *main* has been launched.  
Notice that Ctrl+C is not other than the `SIGINT` **POSIX** signal.
